# Spotify Music Recommendation System Using Clustering Techniques

There are 2 Google Colab notebooks in this repository. One of them compares and evaluates 3 different clustering techniques (K-means, Hierachical and Spectral). The other is a song recommendation system that uses k-means clustering to cluster songs by intrinsic attributes before using the Spotipy API to recommend songs to users based on the input of their 3 favourite songs. 

There are also multiple csv files from which the second notebook takes data from to make the clusters.
